# Documentation of the Craft Multi-Document API

## Craft – API for Portfolio API

**Version:** 1.0.0

### Overview
The Craft Multi-Document API provides programmatic access to multiple Craft documents. Access documents, blocks, collections, and search across your document set with unified authentication.

### Key Concepts

**Document IDs**: Each document is identified by an ID. Use `GET /documents` to discover available documents and their IDs.

**Cross-Document Operations**: Most operations require specifying which document to work with via block IDs. The API automatically resolves which document a block belongs to.

### Recommended Usage
This API is ideal for building integrations that need to work with multiple related documents, such as project documentation sets, knowledge bases, or multi-document workflows.

### Development Tips
- Start with `GET /documents` to discover available documents and their IDs
- Use the `id` parameter in `GET /blocks` with a document's ID to fetch that document's content
- When inserting blocks, use `pageId` in the position object to specify the target document/block
- Use `GET /documents/search` to search across all documents with relevance-based ranking
- Collections can span multiple documents - use `GET /collections` to discover them

### Note for AI
When implementing functionality using this API, always make actual calls to these endpoints and verify the responses. Do not simulate or mock the API interactions or use hard-coded values on the client-side - use the real endpoints to ensure proper functionality and data handling.

**IMPORTANT: This is a production server connected to real user data.** Only perform testing operations that can be safely rolled back:

- Safe: Reading data (`GET` requests), creating test content that you delete immediately after
- Safe: Modifying content if you can restore it to its original state
- Safe: Moving blocks if you can move them back to their original position
- Unsafe: Permanent deletions, modifications without backup, or any changes you cannot reverse

Always verify rollback operations work before considering a test complete.

## Endpoints

## Fetch Blocks

`GET /blocks`

Fetches content from documents in this multi-document connection. Use 'id' query parameter to specify which block to fetch.

Use `Accept` header `application/json` for structured data, `text/markdown` for rendered content.

**Content Rendering:** Text blocks contain markdown formatting and markdown formatted output may include structural tags like `<page></page>`, etc. When displaying content, consider rendering markdown as formatted text or cleaning up the syntax for plain text display.

**Scope Filtering:** Block links in markdown and collections, as well as relations are filtered to documents scope. Block links and date links are returned as `block://` and `date://` URLs.

**Tip:** Start by calling GET /documents to list available documents, then use their documentId values as the 'id' parameter to fetch each document's root content.

### Parameters

- **id** (required) (query): string
  The ID of the page block to fetch. Required for multi-document operations. Accepts IDs for documents, pages and blocks.
- **maxDepth** (query): number
  The maximum depth of blocks to fetch. Default is -1 (all descendants). With a depth of 0, only the specified block is fetched. With a depth of 1, only direct children are returned.
- **fetchMetadata** (query): boolean
  Whether to fetch metadata (comments, createdBy, lastModifiedBy, lastModifiedAt, createdAt) for the blocks. Default is false.
